# Contributing to QVT-Relations

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The Eclipse QVT Declarative (QVTd) component is a partial implementation of the
Core (QVTc) and Relations (QVTr) Languages defined by the OMG standard
specification (MOF) 2.0 Query/View/Transformation. To date the QVT Declarative
component provides editing capabilities to support the QVT Declarative
Languages: QVTd 2010, Helios, 0.7.0 provides QVT models and LPG based parsers
QVTd 2011, Indigo, 0.8.0 adds IMP-based editors. QVTd 2012, Juno, 0.9.0
re-engineers the models and editors to exploit Xtext and the OCL Pivot model.
QVTd 2013, Kepler, 0.10.0 introduces editing and execution of the QVTi
simplification of QVTc. QVTd 2014, Luna, 0.11.0 introduces a source debugger for
QVTi execution. QVTd 2015, Mars, 0.12.0 provides a very preliminary Epsilon
prototype of the QVTr to QVTc to QVTu to QVTm to QVTi chain. QVTd 2016, Neon,
0.13.0 provides a preliminary QVTr to QVTc to QVTu to QVTm to QVTi chain. QVTd
2017, Oxygen, 0.14.0 provides a more useable UMLX to QVTr to QVTc to QVTu to
QVTm to QVTs to QVTi chain and so full editing, compliation, execution,
debugging. QVTd 2018, Photon, 0.15.0 goes direct from QVTr to QVTs to start
supporting QVTr overrides.
